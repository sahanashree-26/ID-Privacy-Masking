# ID-Privacy-Masking
This project is a basic cybersecurity solution that uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to detect and automatically mask sensitive personal information in ID card images. Built using Python, OpenCV, and Tesseract, it helps in preserving privacy by identifying key data like name, roll number, and year, and hiding it with black boxes.
